# How to use Glamaholic

Thank you for installing Glamaholic! This plugin can act as your home for
glamours, since you can store as many as you would like in it. To get started,
try reading the section called "Adding glamour plates". Keep in mind that you'll
need to be editing your plates at the Glamour Dresser to be able to copy those
plates into the plugin or apply new plates.
